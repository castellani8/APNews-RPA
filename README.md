## Note on Filters
### The only variable (work item) you need to set is "search_phrase".
### The system will automatically get the latest news.
#### Although a category filter was built, it doesn't make sense on the AP News website, and a date filter hasn't been built because the website doesn't allow date filtering (even with query params).
